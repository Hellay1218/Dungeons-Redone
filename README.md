##  About
**a resource pack that adds minecraft dungeons weapons as renames for your tools with a reimagened style!**

please keep in mind this pack is still wip, not done and more will be added later! :D

also tries to be compatible with [hold my items](https://modrinth.com/mod/hold-my-items)

## The Renames
the renames both work with the start of the names being uppercase and lower case

(for example both Dancer's Sword and dancer's sword will work for getting the dancer's sword)
